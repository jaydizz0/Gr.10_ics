                        </div>
                        <p>Oral infections like gingivitis and tartar buildup are two of the most common diseases in dogs diagnosed after the age of three. Odontal diseases such as abscesses may be a more severe version of this. In this category, look for difficulty with or avoidance of hard foods, bad breath, discoloured teeth or gums, loose teeth, and lumps on the gums or under the tongue. Keeping up with your dog's dental care can help prevent situations like this from happening. Regular veterinary visits for teeth cleaning can aid in the prevention of dental disease. Teeth cleaning is sometimes included in the regular packages of dog grooming companies.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>If you notice your dog scratching their ears frequently or exhibiting recurring head tipping or shaking, you should have their ears checked for infection. Other symptoms include fur loss, odour, and redness or swelling of the ear canal. If ear infections reoccur, there is a chance that allergies are involved. You can prevent ear infections by thoroughly drying your dogs' ears after they have been in water, using a dog cleaning solution to clean out your pets' ears on a regular basis, and managing any allergies appropriately.</p>

                        <p>Unlike normal scratching behaviour in dogs, persistent constant scratching can indicate a skin condition, infection, or allergy. Some foods, such as soy, wheat, and corn, can cause skin allergies in dogs. Other causes include bacterial or yeast infections, which can cause Hot Spots or painful sores. Your veterinarian can treat these conditions with antibiotics, dietary changes, or specialised shampoo to help treat the skin issues that are presenting.</p>

                        <p>When dogs get older, they can develop arthritis and joint pain, especially if they gain too much weight for their size. Overexertion, bacterial encephalitis, and parasitic infestations are all possible causes of joint stiffness and pain. Awkward gaits, reluctance to rise, limb rigidity, swelling, muscle spasms, depression, or noticeable fatigue are all potential indicators of inflammation and stiffness. Treatment is determined by the conditions identified by your veterinarian. More information on how to make your dog more comfortable if he or she is in pain due to stiffness or inflammation can be found here.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>This is an umbrella term for a variety of respiratory infections that can be bacterial or viral in nature and affect the windpipe and/or voice box. The bacterium Bordetella bronchiseptica and the canine parainfluenza virus are the two most common causes. Kennel Cough is named after the ability of a respiratory infection to spread quickly through enclosed facilities with limited air circulation, such as a kennel or shelter. These infections can spread through contaminated air, water, or objects. A dry cough, gagging sound, fever, or coughing up white foam are all symptoms of a respiratory illness. Making sure your dog's vaccinations are up to date is one method of contraction prevention. To treat these respiratory conditions, you should consult your veterinarian and keep your pet isolated from other animals to prevent further spreading.  </p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Weight management in dogs can be a difficult topic because many dog owners struggle to acknowledge when their pet is overweight. As a result, one of the most overlooked threats to pet longevity is this health issue. Obesity is frequently associated with a wide range of health issues, including high blood pressure, chronic kidney disease, arthritis, liver disease, low thyroid hormone production, diabetes, and cancer. To combat this, you should feed your dog appropriate portion sizes and keep them active by playing with them and taking them on walks.</p>

                            <h2>Ringworm</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>Contrary to its name, ringworm is a highly contagious fungus that can infect the skin, hair, and nails. In dogs, it can also lead to patches of hair loss. Ringworm unfortunately can also spread from a canine to a human easily. What does correlate with this condition’s name is the circular spots it creates that are sometimes red in the center, which are used to help identify this illness. Other characteristics to look out for are skin lesions that most commonly occur on the head, ears, paws, and forelimbs, though it is possible for dogs to carry this illness and have no symptoms at all. Dogs that are less than a year old, that have experienced malnourishment, or are immunocompromised are also at a higher risk of contracting ringworm. Treatment practices for ringworm depends on the severity of the infection and should be diagnosed by a professional. </p>

                        <p>The title of this illness, unfortunately, does in fact describe a parasitic worm that lives in the heart and arteries of infected animals. Heartworm is an illness transmitted from one animal to another by mosquitoes. Screening for heartworm should be done on an annual basis through blood testing. Quite disturbingly these parasites travel through the bloodstream, damaging arteries and organs, and typically spreading after six months all the way to the heart and lungs. Symptoms can be weight loss, fatigue, labored breathing, coughing, vomiting, or no symptoms at all. However, this condition, thankfully, is easily preventable with inexpensive medication, but if left untreated can be fatal. </p>

                            <p>Each year, approximately 6 million of the approximately 65 million dogs in the United States are diagnosed with cancer. Cancer, on the other hand, is not always fatal, despite being one of the most difficult conditions to diagnose. Once confirmed, many of the same treatment options available to humans are also used for dogs. Chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery are a few examples. There are many different types of cancer that can affect dogs, and some are much more treatable than others.</p>

                            <p>Dogs, like humans, can develop Type I and Type 2 diabetes and face some of the same complications as we do. The most common form of the disease in dogs is Type I, which necessitates insulin therapy for survival. This happens when a dog's pancreas is unable to produce enough insulin on its own to keep the body running. Excessive thirst, weight loss, sweet or fruity breath, cataract formation, chronic skin or urinary tract infections, and lethargy are all signs that your dog may be diabetic. Some breeds are also more susceptible to these conditions than others.</p>
